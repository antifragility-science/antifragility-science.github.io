**Applied Antifragility Research Group**

As coined in the book of Nassim Taleb, antifragility is a property of a system to gain from uncertainty, randomness, and volatility, opposite to what fragility would incur. An antifragile systemâ€™s response to external perturbations is beyond robust, such that small stressors can strengthen the future response of the system by adding a strong anticipation component. 

**Group mission and paths**

Our research group's mission is to build a foundational knowledge base by applying antifragile system design, analysis, and development across domains. We are interested in formalizing principles and an apparatus that turns the basic concept of antifragility into a tool for designing and building closed-loop systems that behave beyond robust in the face of uncertainty.

We are a very diverse group of researchers from different fields. Such an interdisciplinary constellation allows us to explore applied antifragility through multiple paths.
